Today is Day-64 and Today I learned about Pointers Relationship with array || Arithmetic Pointers...
Today's HW is:
1: Print the address of the first index of the char array in c++.
2: Print the address of the char variable in c++.
3: Print the address of String in c++.
4: Given an array in c++

int arr[5] = {1,2,3,4,5};

What is the difference between arr and &arr. Try to explore it on your own.

5: int arr[5] = {1,2,3,4,5};
Create a pointer which will store the address of the last element. Then print all the elements from the last index to 0th index with the help of a pointer.
