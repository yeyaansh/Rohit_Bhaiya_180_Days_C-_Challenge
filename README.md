Today is Day 12 and today I learned about Operators in C++
Today's HW is:

1: Temperature Range: Write a program that checks if a given temperature is suitable for swimming. If the temperature is between 70 and 90 (Excluded) degrees Fahrenheit print yes, else NO.

2: Even and Positive Number: Write a program that prints “YES” if a given number is both even and positive, otherwise it will print “NO”.

3: Age Check: Implement a program that checks if a person is a teenager. A teenager is someone whose age is between 13 and 19 (inclusive).

4: Take three numbers a,b,c from the user, print yes if a is either greater than b or c. Otherwise print NO.

5: What will be the result below according to the precedence table.

    2*3-48==5/4*6
    6<<2-4*8/2
    5>4<3/2-8%4+5
    14-8+92>>2+70
