1: Print sum of each column in 2D array.
2: Given 2 matrices A and B, Print A-B.
3: Given a matrix of size n*n, Print sum of diagonal element.
 Ex:   1 2 3
       4 5 6
       7 8 9

Its answer: 1+5+9 , 3+5+7, So the total sum will be 1+5+9+3+5+7 = 30. Here we can see that 5 is included 2 times, so we should include it only 1 time so the final answer will be, 30-5 = 25.  So the final answer will be 25.

4: What is the column major order? 
5: Largest Element: Find and print the largest element in the 2D array.
6: Smallest Element: Find and print the smallest element in the 2D arrays.
