Today is Day 11 and today I learned about Pattern-Printing Problems -- Super Hard Mode
Today's HW is:

First Pattern: Take an input n from the user, and create a pattern like below, for n=5, we have output like this.

            *
           *  *
         *  *  *
       *  *  *  *
     *  *  *  *  *

Second Pattern: Take an input n from the user, and create a pattern like below, for n=5, we have output like this.

              1
          1 2 3
       1 2 3 4 5
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

Third Pattern: Take an input n from the user, and create a pattern like below, for n=5, we have output like this.

              A
          A B A
       A B C B A
    A B C D C B A

A B C D E D C B A

Fourth Pattern: Take an input n from the user, and create a pattern like below, for n=5, we have output like this.

            *
           *  *
