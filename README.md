Today is Day-37 and Today I learned about STL (standard template library), and Vector and operations on them...
Today's HW is:

//<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<DAY-37>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

1. Prove that the average time Complexity of Push_back operation in Vector is O(1) time.
2. How to find the number of Occurance of an element in a vector. You need to use STL here.
3. How to find maximum and minimum elements from the vector. USE STL here.
4. Find Lower bound and Upper Bound of a given element in a sorted vector. USE STL here to find them.
5. How to pass a vector to a function. Write a small code for it.
