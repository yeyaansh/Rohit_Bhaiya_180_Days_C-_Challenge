Today is Day 15 and today I learned about while loop, do-while loop switch case and scope of a variable
Today's HW is:
1: Take a number n from the user and print all the even numbers between 1 and n(inclusive). Do this using while and do while loop separately.

2: Find the factorial of a number n using a while loop and do a while loop.

3: Given a number n, print all the numbers from 1 to n(inclusive) which are not divisible by 3 and 5. (use Continue here).

4: Given a number n, print the corresponding month of it. For n=1, print Jan, n=2, print Feb…, if the user puts any invalid number, don’t do anything. (Use switch here)

5: Print all the Capital and small letters using a while loop. It means A-Z, then a-z.

6: Give a number n, find if it is prime or not, use a while loop and break here to solve it.
